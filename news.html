                    <p>
                        Object Oriented Programming in C++ is a comprehensive solution for teaching object-oriented
                        programming using the features of ANSI/ISO C++. It covers the basic concepts of object-oriented
                        programming, why those concepts exist and how to make them work effectively. The Fourth Edition is
                        updated and revised to include more UML coverage, inter-file communication and use-cases analysis to
                        explain software design. The book covers object-oriented programming through task-oriented examples
                        and figures to conceptualize the techniques and approaches used. It also contains questions and
                        exercises to reinforce the concepts students have learned.

                        Python Programming introduces one of the most rapidly evolving and preferred programming language
                        using the concept of modularity. One of the highlights of the text is its in-depth treatment of
                        basic concepts. Advanced topics are discussed with multiple examples of applications from various
                        fields such as database management, web and, mobile application development.Features1.

                    <p>
                        This book has been conceived and written with the objective of providing students with a
                        comprehensive text book on Data Structure. The book follows a simple definition, logic and
                        algorithmic approach, as against a theorem and proof-based approach, for explaining basic data
                        structure concepts. The approach stems from the author's experience in teaching undergraduate and
                        postgraduate students of BE, BTech, MCA, BCA, M.Sc. and B.Sc. courses, and also by students pursuing
                        courses such as O, A, B, and C levels conducted by the DOEACC Society. The book targets
                        undergraduate and postgraduate engineering students who study data structure as a core subjects.
